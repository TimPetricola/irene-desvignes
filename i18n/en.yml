    <p>The recent period, based on the ISLAND, leads towards a series of paintings on canvas and paper and as  well small sculptures. The spatial configuration of the ISLAND brings a fertile metaphorical energy. The ISLAND is also the place of the elsewhere, of the strangeness, the place of questions and promises. Within it lie the forces of eruption and recomposition. The approach of Irene Desvignes happily brings us to the sources of nature as  means to enrich our knowledge of the world and of the existence. In this way, the land power meets the  human impulse. To isolate, to open, to lift, to bury, to dig, to resurface ... are all layers of our intimate geology.</p>
